For doctor recomondation system, i opted for machine learning technology to train a machine learning model, which takes sympoms of a patient and based on those symptoms it will predict the type of diseace. once we are able to know the diseace we can map patient with the doctors based on availability . For this i used a sample dataset which consists patient symptoms and type of disease then i performed couple of preprocessing steps to make sure data is clean and ready to be processed. Then i used some of ml algorithms like RandomForest, Naive bayes and Logistic regression wher all of them are giving 100 percentage accuracy so we can proceed with any of thes 3 models.


packages and tools used:
python >3.7
sklearn 0.24.2
pandas 1.2.1
